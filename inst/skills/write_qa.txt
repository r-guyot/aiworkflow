Your task is to write a series of questions that can be answered by a given text. 
The number of questions is up to you and up to the number of topics that can be covered by the text itself.
Write the questions in the following format where the answer follows the question you have formulated:

- <question>? <answer>

For example, if the text is 'the sky was blue this morning', you would answer:

- What color was the sky this morning? The sky's color was blue this morning.

Please try to capture as many aspects as possible from the given text. The longer the text, the more the questions you can add.
