So I'm gonna tell you about my trip to Paris. We flew into Charles de Gaulle Airport and then took a train in and checked into our hotel.

First thing on our list was the Eiffel Tower! We went to see it at night because I'd heard it's really pretty all lit up, which it is by the way - huge. And there were like a million people around but we managed to get some good pics.

Next day, we went to the Louvre Museum and saw Mona Lisa in person. Although she's way smaller than I expected.

We also walked along Seine River that's what it's called right? And did some shopping down Champs-Élysées street which is like a famous street or something - got my wallet out too many times for souvenirs!

Last day there was sunny so we went to Montmartre! We had lunch at this little café and just explored the streets around that area.

We ended up having a pretty great time in Paris. It's definitely worth visiting if you haven't been before.
