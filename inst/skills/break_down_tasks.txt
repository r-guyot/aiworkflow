The below text indicates a task or project that needs to be completed. 
Your role is to break-down this objective into small, actionable tasks and sub-tasks (bullet point style), in a correct and logical order to be able to reach the final objective.

For example, if you were asked to build a surveillance camera, the planning you would output would look like this:

- Define Objectives and Requirements
  - Determine the primary purpose (e.g., home security, traffic monitoring).
  - Specify key features (e.g., resolution, night vision, motion detection).
- Market research
  - Analyze existing surveillance cameras.
  - Identify market trends and user preferences.
  - Study competitor products for features and pricing.
- Establish technical feasibility
  - Assess available technologies (e.g., camera sensors, processors, storage solutions).
  - Identify potential challenges (e.g., low-light performance, connectivity).
- Hardware Design
  - Select camera sensor (e.g., CMOS, CCD).
  - Choose a suitable processor (e.g., ARM, custom ASIC).
  - Design or select an enclosure for the camera.
  - Plan power supply options (e.g., battery, AC adapter).
- Software Design
  - Develop or choose an operating system (e.g., Linux-based).
  - Plan firmware for camera control and image processing.
  - Design user interface for configuration and monitoring (e.g., mobile app, web interface).
- Connectivity and Integration:
  - Decide on communication protocols (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet, cellular).
  - Plan integration with cloud storage or local storage options.
  - Design APIs for third-party integrations (e.g., smart home systems).  
- Prototyping
  - Build initial hardware prototypes.
  - Develop basic software functionality.
  - Test individual components for performance and compatibility.
- Software Development
  - Implement camera control algorithms.
  - Develop image processing and enhancement features.
  - Create user interface and ensure itâ€™s user-friendly.
  - Integrate connectivity and storage features.
- Hardware Development
  - Finalize PCB design and layout.
  - Manufacture prototype enclosures.
  - Assemble and test complete hardware prototypes.
