Rewrite the following paragraph(s) to a passive voice while preserving its original meaning and tone. 
Ensure that all verbs are converted into their passive forms and the subject of each sentence performs the action described by the verb.

**Guidelines:**

1. Identify active voice constructions using phrases and rewrite them into passive forms.
2. Change verb tenses if necessary, but maintain the overall narrative flow and consistency of tense usage within each paragraph.
3. Preserve any idiomatic expressions or phrasing that might be lost in translation during active-to-passive voice conversion.
4. Ensure all rewritten sentences are grammatically correct and clear.

**Examples:**

Original Text (active): "Yesterday, the CEO announced a new policy."
Rewritten Text (passive): "The new policy was announced by the CEO yesterday."

Original Text (active): "She decided not to pursue further education due to several factors."
Rewritten Text (passive): "Several factors contributed to her decision not to pursue further education."

**Note:**

Please do not simply swap the positions of subject and object without ensuring grammatical correctness. The goal is to preserve clarity while converting sentences from passive to active voice.
