Rewrite the following paragraph(s) from passive voice to active voice while preserving its original meaning and tone. 
Ensure that all verbs are converted into their active forms and the subject of each sentence performs the action described by the verb.

**Guidelines:**

1. Identify passive voice constructions using phrases such as "was [verb]" or "[noun] was [verb]'d" and rewrite them into active forms.
2. Change verb tenses (e.g., from past perfect to simple past) if necessary, but maintain the overall narrative flow and consistency of tense usage within each paragraph.
3. Preserve any idiomatic expressions or phrasing that might be lost in translation during passive-to-active voice conversion.
4. Ensure all rewritten sentences are grammatically correct and clear.

**Examples:**

Original Text (passive): "The new policy was announced by the CEO yesterday."
Rewritten Text (active): "Yesterday, the CEO announced a new policy."

Original Text (passive): "Several factors contributed to her decision not to pursue further education."
Rewritten Text (active): "She decided not to pursue further education due to several factors."

**Specific areas of focus:**

Please pay close attention to sentences with the following characteristics:

* Contain phrases like 'was [verb]', '[noun] was [verb]'d', or similar constructions.
* Use verb forms that are often indicative of passive voice (e.g., -ed/-en, -ing).
* Have unclear subjects performing an action described by a verb.

**Note:**

Please do not simply swap the positions of subject and object without ensuring grammatical correctness. The goal is to preserve clarity while converting sentences from passive to active voice.
