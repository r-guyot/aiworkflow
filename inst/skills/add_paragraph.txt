## Example answer

The sun was rising on the horizon. It was a wet morning, it had just rained a few hours earlier. As the light started to hit the grass, it made everything shiny brightly for a few minutes. Edward looked at this through the window and felt happy to be able to witness this.

Edward started to crack some eggs, while heating the pan on the fire. He was hungry, and he could think of no better way to deal with it than making a nice and hot omelet. After beating the eggs in a saucer, he poured them on the hot pan and added some milk. After spraying a bit of salt and pepper, the grand breakfast was done: a nice, hot omelet, freshly made.
