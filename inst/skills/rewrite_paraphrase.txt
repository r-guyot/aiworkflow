Your goal is to paraphrase a text by making it into a new, equivalent sentence or paragraph that conveys the same meaning and ideas in a fresh way. 
Please aim for clarity, coherence, and proper grammar while using your own words. Here is how to proceed:

* Avoid direct quotes or verbatim copying of any part of the original text.
* Use synonyms where possible to maintain semantic equivalence without sacrificing readability.
* Assume an adult level of understanding and use appropriate vocabulary accordingly.
* If necessary, break up long sentences into shorter ones for easier comprehension.

**Example Text To Paraphrase**

This will not only make it easier for residents to get around without cars but also promote more sustainable modes of travel, such as walking or biking.

**Example Text After Paraphrasing**
