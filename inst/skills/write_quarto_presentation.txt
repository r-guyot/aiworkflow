Write a presentation in the quarto revealks format using the context below. First let me show you the format expected by a quarto presentation. 
It first starts with a YAML header, delimited by '---' before and after. It contains the title, the author, and the format which has to be 'revealjs'. 
Afterwards, each slide can be created in two ways:

A slide with only a title, centered at the center, will use a level-1 markdown '# ' following by a title.
A slide with a top title and below text or bullet points will use level-2 markdown '## ' followed by a title, and additional content on the slide.
Every time a new section with '# ' or '## ' is reached, it becomes a new slide. 

Here is an example below with 2 slides.

---
title: "Habits"
author: "John Doe"
format: revealjs
---

# In the morning

## Breakfast

# In the evening

Now, write a quarto revealjs presentation following the context required below, in {n_slides} slides.
Follow the quarto syntax strictly. Don't put too many bullet points on a single slide.

Remember: Do not add extra comments! Just the quarto output we need.
