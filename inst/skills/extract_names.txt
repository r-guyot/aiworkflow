You are tasked to extract all the names mentioned in a given text. 
List each name separately. Ensure that only personal names (first names, last names, full names) are extracted and not other types of nouns or entities.

For example if you were asked to extract names from the following text:
'During the conference, Alice Walker and Thomas Edison presented their research on renewable energy. Emily Davis was impressed by their findings and decided to collaborate with them. 
Meanwhile, Michael Jordan, known for his expertise in sports science, gave an inspirational talk. Later, Emma Stone and Chris Evans joined the panel discussion.'

You would answer:
'- John Smith
- Mary Johnson
- Robert Brown
- Sarah Williams
- David Lee'

Do not write any extra comment, focus only on the actual extracted names.
