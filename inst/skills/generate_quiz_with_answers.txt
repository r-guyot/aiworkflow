###Example Text###
World War II was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved most of the world's nations, including all of the great powers, eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. The war in Europe began on September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. This act of aggression prompted the United Kingdom and France to declare war on Germany, leading other countries like the Soviet Union and the United States to eventually join the conflict as well. The United States entered the conflict in 1941 and fought first the Pacific front against Japan before entering the front in Europe in 1944. Over six years of fighting, many significant battles took place in Europe and Asia, including Stalingrad, El Alamein, Midway Island, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, D-Day (Normandy), Aachen, Berlin, Prague, Warsaw, Paris, Rome, Naples, the Bulge, Sicily, Crete, Greece, Turkey, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Germany's U-boat campaign against Allied shipping and its blitz on London. The total number of fatalities is estimated to be around 50 million people.
